## 1. Introduction

> If one's first ask yourself what the structure of convincing proof would be and, having found this, then constructs a program satisfying this proof's requirements.. ~~ The Humble Programmer, Edsger W. Dijkstra (1972)

> It is necessary to have a hand calculated check case with which to compare the answers which will later be calculated by the machine. ~~ Digital Computer Programming, D.D McCracken (1957)

> The first step is to write a test that fails. ~~ Test Driven Development by Example, Kent Beck (2002)

- Testable code
- Enables refactoring
- Higher quality code

3. Thinking tool

- Less debugging
- More coding time

4. Documentation

- Living documentation
- Examples
- Specifications
